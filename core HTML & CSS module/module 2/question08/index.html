    <h2> Full stack web development tech stack</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Servers and load balancing</dt>
        <dd>This category include servers, content distribution networks, routing, and caching services that let your
            applications send and receive requests, run smoothly, and scale capacity as needed. The larger services,
            like Amazon’s and Google’s, often offer the same components offered by their smaller counterparts, but they
            typically allow you to purchase each service as a line item, so you can mix and match based on your product
            requirements and preferred pricing structure.</dd>
        <dt>Data storage and querying</dt>
        <dd>This layer of the stack consists of relational and non-relational databases, data warehouses, and data
            pipelines that allow you to store and query all of your real-time and historical data. These components are
            key for storing data about what happens inside your app and how users behave when using it. Later you can
            search this data and use it to improve your product.</dd>
        <dt>Backend Frameworks</dt>
        <dd> A framework is a collection of languages, libraries, and utilities designed to help developers build
            applications. Frameworks often include some of the basic functionality you’ll need to build an app, and
            provides structure for things like organizing and communicating with your database, handling requests from
            users, and sending out registration or password reset emails. While some choose to forgo frameworks and code
            everything from scratch, they often end up with a more complicated, time-consuming build.</dd>
        <dt>Frontend Framework</dt>
        <dd>The services and frameworks you use to build the user experience, including the user interface and all the
            client-side functionality in your product.</dd>
        <dt>API services</dt>
        <dd> The applications that help you connect to the tools that make up your extended tech stack. Some API
            services are simply collections of thousands of pre-built APIs, while others are API gateways that help
            manage traffic when you need to send and receive large quantities off information from other systems.</dd>
