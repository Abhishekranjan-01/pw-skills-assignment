        <p>PW Skills, the skilling vertical of Physics Wallah launched late last year, has outlined a plan to invest Rs
            120 crore in the next two-three years to provide upskilling courses at competitive prices.</p><br>
        <p>"We want to address the issue of inaccessibility and steep pricing of most tech and upskilling courses, as
            well as the lack of practical training and teaching of basics. Additionally, there is a significant gap in
            training availability in vernacular languages. PW Skills is committed to bridging these gaps by investing Rs
            120 crore in the next 2-3 years to provide quality content, taught from the basics by industry
            professionals, at competitive prices," said Prateek Maheshwari, Co-Founder of PW, in a statement.</p><br>
        <p>The platform currently has over 1.5 lakh registered learners, enrolled with its courses offered in Hindi,
            English, and "Hinglish". Among these learners, 50,000 have enrolled in paid batches, while the rest benefit
            from the free courses. About 30,000 learners hail from the Hindi heartland, encompassing regions such as
            Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and other states, according to the statement.</p><br>
        <p>PW Skills provides hybrid courses in data science, Java, C++, full-stack web development, and other tech
            courses starting from Rs 3,500. The platform plans to expand into joint certification courses with colleges,
            diploma courses, and technology courses in vernacular languages.</p><br>
